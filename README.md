# Front-end-ZombieRun

ZombieRun is a REact Native app that incentives joggers by being pursued by a zombie.

ZombieRun is a gamified running app. The user can create an account where previous run history is stored and can select either a normal run or a zombie chase. The zombie chase has 3 difficulties (easy, normal and hard) and its pace is customisable in km/hr as well as the distance to run.
